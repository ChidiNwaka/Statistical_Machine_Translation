# Project Description:
- In this project, 3 major tasks are completed:
    -  We represent English & French language data using an n-gram language model
    (experimented with unigram, bigram, and trigram models), and measure
    the probability distribution over our language by using MLE with
    add-delta smoothing (extended form of Laplace smoothing) - and
    experimented with several delta values (analysis of impact
    of varying delta in [Task3.txt](https://github.com/ChidiNwaka/Statistical_Machine_Translation/blob/master/Task3.txt))
    - We implement the IBM-1 algorithm to learn word alignments between
    English and French words (thereby allowing us to translate from one
    to the other)
    - We use the IBM BlueMix service to obtain reference translations, and
    implement the BLEU-metric algorithm to measure the performance of our
    translation algorithm.
