Project Description:
In this project, 3 major tasks are completed:

We represent English & French language data using an n-gram language model (experimented with unigram, bigram, and trigram models), and measure the probability distribution over our language by using MLE with add-delta smoothing (extended form of Laplace smoothing) - and experimented with several delta values (analysis of impact of varying delta in <a href='www.github.com'>Task3.txt</a>)
We implement the IBM-1 algorithm to learn word alignments between English and French words (thereby allowing us to translate from one to the other)
We use the IBM BlueMix service to obtain reference translations, and implement the BLEU-metric algorithm to measure the performance of our translation algorithm.
